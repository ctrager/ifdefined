			BugTracker.NET allows you to base permissions on "projects" or "organizations" or both. The terms "projects"
			and "organizations" are somewhat flexible and maybe even overlapping.
			BugTracker.NET also recognizes the difference between "internal" and "external" users. Setting up
			permissions so that they match your situation might require some experimentation. Because you can use both
			projects and organizations, there could be more than one way to setup the permission scheme that fits your
			needs. To get you started, here are a few scenarios and how you might use permissions to handle them.
			<br><br><br><br>
			1. Scenario: You are a small team and you trust everybody. You don't want any permissions to get in the way.
			You want a simple bug tracker.
		<p>
			Setup: Set "DefaultPermissionLevel" to "2" in Web.config. That gives everybody permission to all projects.
			You could still use per-project permissions to explicitly revoke permissions for specific users and
			projects. You can even use the following .css to hide the project and organization fields on the edit bug
			page:
			<br>
			#row1 {display:none;}<br>
			#row2 {display:none;}<br>
			<br><br><br><br>
			2. Scenario: You are using BugTracker.NET internally within your company. You have several project teams.
			Only members of a given project team are allowed to edit bugs for that team.
		<p>
			Setup: Set "DefaultPermissionLevel" in Web.config to 0. This denies everybody permission to all projects
			except where permission is explicitly granted. Create a BugTracker.NET project for each project team. Edit
			users so that they have the "all" permission for the project they are a member of and leave the others set
			to "none".
			<br><br><br><br>
			3. Scenario: Same as above, but you do want to allow all bugs to be viewable.
		<p>
			Setup: Set "DefaultProjectLevel" in Web.config to 1. Leave the setting for the other projects to "view
			only".
			<br><br><br><br>
			4. Scenario: Your team has several customers. You want your customers to use BugTracker.NET too, but you
			don't want one customer to see another customer's bugs. You also want to be able to post comments to bugs
			that you don't want the customers to see.
		<p>
			Setup: Set "EnableInternalOnlyPosts" to "1" in Web.config. This allows you to post comments to bugs that
			user who are marked "external" can't see. Create a BugTracker.NET organization for each customer. Check the
			"external" flag on the organization. Set "Permission level for bugs associated with other (or no)
			organizations" to "None". Create another organization naming it something like "Internal" and set
			"Permission level for bugs associated with other (or no) organizations" to "Add/Edit". When a customer-user
			adds a bug, it will automatically be associated with the organization, and other customers won't be able to
			see it. Your internal users will be able to see the bugs for all customers.

			<br><br><br><br>
			5. Scenario: You want people to be able to view bugs without having to create a user account for them.
		<p>
			Setup: Create a user named "guest". There is special logic in BugTracker.NET to handle the guest user
			differently. First of all, you can't give the guest user permissions any stronger than Reporter. Second, the
			link to "settings" and the button to "Save search as query" are not available to the guest user. You can
			also set the Web.config setting "AllowGuestWithoutLogin" to "1" which allows anybody to access your
			BugTracker.NET as "guest" without logging in at all.

			<br><br><br><br>
			6. Scenario: Some people can see the status but can't change it. Some people are not allowed to even see the
			"assigned to" field.
		<p>
			Setup: Create an organzation and set the "Status" permission for that organization to "Read Only". Create
			another organization and set its "Assigned to" permission to "None".
