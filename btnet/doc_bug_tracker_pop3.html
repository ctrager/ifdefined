<span class=hdg>Receiving email using btnet_service.exe</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=README.html#toc style="font-size: 7pt;">[back to contents]</a>
<p>
One of the powerful features of BugTracker.NET is its ability to
receive an email and treat it as a bug entry. Once it's in the
database, you can respond to the email from within BugTracker.NET
and your response will be tracked. The apps that receive the
emails are btnet_console.exe and btnet_service.exe. Btnet_console.exe
and btnet_service.exe are POP3 clients that fetch email and stuff them in
the database as bugs. You configure the email accounts on the project
pages - you can use a different email account per project.
You can also respond to emails from within btnet and the
responses are saved.
<p>
Btnet_console.exe and btnet_service.exe do the same thing, but one is
just a console app and the other is a service. Try running the console
app first because it is verbose and will help you debug your configuration.
    <p>
Both of them get their settings from the "btnet_service.exe.config" file.
<p>
Running btnet_console:
<p>
Enter "btnet_console.exe btnet_service.exe.config" when you are in
btnet's directory.
<p>
Running btnet_service.exe:
<p>
Use "installutil.exe" to install btnet_service.exe as a Windows service.

Here's the command I typed, all on one line:

<div class=dos>
c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319>installutil c:\btnet\btnet_service\bin\release\btnet_service.exe
</div>

<p>
And if it works, this the output I see:

<p>
Btnet_service.exe looks for btnet_service.exe.config in its own folder.
(Older versions were hard-coded to look in the c:\ folder).
<p>
Read the comments in btnet_service.exe.config. Note that one service
instance can support multiple websites.
<p>
The service communicates with the website via the page insert_bug.aspx. It cannot use windows security.

<p>

Instead of running btnet_service.exe and configuring it via btnet_service.exe.config, you 
can specify in Web.config that the ASP.NET application itself creates a worker 
thread that does the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the one hand, this new way is 
easier to setup and configure than btnet_service.exe.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other 
hand, this new way won&#39;t work if you are running BugTracker.NET on a shared host 
with ASP.NET &quot;Medium Trust&quot;, because &quot;Medium Trust&quot; won&#39;t allow an ASP.NET to 
create an outgoing TCP/IP connection to the POP3 server.&nbsp; See the &quot;Pop3...&quot; 
settings in Web.config for more info.<p>
