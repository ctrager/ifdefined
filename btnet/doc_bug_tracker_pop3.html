		<p>
			One of the powerful features of BugTracker.NET is its ability to
			receive an email and treat it as a bug entry. Once it's in the
			database, you can respond to the email from within BugTracker.NET
			and your response will be tracked. The apps that receive the
			emails are btnet_console.exe and btnet_service.exe. Btnet_console.exe
			and btnet_service.exe are POP3 clients that fetch email and stuff them in
			the database as bugs. You configure the email accounts on the project
			pages - you can use a different email account per project.
			You can also respond to emails from within btnet and the
			responses are saved.
		<p>
			Btnet_console.exe and btnet_service.exe do the same thing, but one is
			just a console app and the other is a service. Try running the console
			app first because it is verbose and will help you debug your configuration.
		<p>
			Both of them get their settings from the "btnet_service.exe.config" file.
		<p>
			Running btnet_console:
		<p>
			Enter "btnet_console.exe btnet_service.exe.config" when you are in
			btnet's directory.
		<p>
			Running btnet_service.exe:
		<p>
			Use "installutil.exe" to install btnet_service.exe as a Windows service.

			Here's the command I typed, all on one line:

		<div class=dos>
			c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319>installutil
			c:\btnet\btnet_service\bin\release\btnet_service.exe
		</div>

		<p>
			And if it works, this the output I see:

		<p>
			Btnet_service.exe looks for btnet_service.exe.config in its own folder.
			(Older versions were hard-coded to look in the c:\ folder).
		<p>
			Read the comments in btnet_service.exe.config. Note that one service
			instance can support multiple websites.
		<p>
			The service communicates with the website via the page insert_bug.aspx. It cannot use windows security.

		<p>

			Instead of running btnet_service.exe and configuring it via btnet_service.exe.config, you
			can specify in Web.config that the ASP.NET application itself creates a worker
			thread that does the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the one hand, this new way is
			easier to setup and configure than btnet_service.exe.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other
			hand, this new way won&#39;t work if you are running BugTracker.NET on a shared host
			with ASP.NET &quot;Medium Trust&quot;, because &quot;Medium Trust&quot; won&#39;t allow an ASP.NET to
			create an outgoing TCP/IP connection to the POP3 server.&nbsp; See the &quot;Pop3...&quot;
			settings in Web.config for more info.
