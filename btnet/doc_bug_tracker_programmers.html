		<p>
			The file &quot;insert_bug.aspx&quot; actually serves as the API for inserting new bugs and appending posts
			to existing bugs.
			Insert_bug.aspx is what's used by the BugTracker.NET screen capture utility and btnet_service.exe.
			Any program that can send an HTTP request can use the API.
		<p>
			To use it, send an HTTP request with a URL like so (ignore the line breaks):
		<p>
			insert_bug.aspx?username=YOURUSERNAME<br>
			&password=YOURPASSWORD<br>
			&short_desc=YOUR+SHORT_DESC<br>
			&comment=YOUR+COMMENT&projectid=YOUR_PJID
		<p>
			The response will either be ERROR: followed by the specifics of the error or OK: followed by the bug id.
		<p>
			To add a comment to an existing bug, format a URL like the following:
		<p>
			insert_bug.aspx?username=YOURUSERNAME<br>
			&password=YOURPASSWORD<br>
			&bugid=9999&comment=YOUR+COMMENT
		<p>
			You can experiment with these URLs by typing them directly into your browser's address bar.
		<p>
			HTTP "GET" requests, where the payload is in the URL, have a size limit, so for larger requests, format a
			POST.
		<p>
			For the GET query string or POST form variables, the variable names are:<br>
		<ul>
			username<br>
			password<br>
			bugid<br>
			short_desc<br>
			comment<br>
			projectid - the integer id of the project)<br>
		</ul>

		For attachments:<br>

		<ul>

			attachment - a base64 encoded version of the file to be attached. Typically, an image.<br>
			attachment_content_type - for example "image/jpeg"<br>
			attachment_filename - for example, "screenshot.jpg"<br>
			attachment_desc<br>

		</ul>

		<p>
			See the insert_bug.aspx itself for more complete and up-to-date info. Don't just trust this documentation.
		<p>
			Neither the screen capture nor btnet_service.exe can use IIS's Windows security, but there's a workaround if
			you use Windows security:
			You can change the website so that insert_bug.aspx ONLY is configured not to use windows security.
			That is, you can set the security at the level of a page, not just at the level of a virtual directory.

		<p>

			You have the source code to BugTracker.NET, so you can edit that source code however you want.
			But editing the BugTracker.NET source code might make it harder for you to upgrade to new and improved
			versions of BugTracker.NET.
		<p>
			The file <b>App_Code\Workflow.cs</b> is an isolated place where you can centralize your customizations so
			that when you upgrade, you don't lose them.
			The page <b>edit_bug.aspx</b> calls <b>custom_adjust_controls()</b> before a page is displayed to give you a
			chance to modify the controls on the page.
			For example, you could limit the list of statuses a particular user is allowed to select. Later,
			edit_bug.aspx calls <b>custom_validations()</b>
			to give you a chance to add your own validation logic and error messages.

		<p>
			There is sample code in the file itself that you can use to get started.

		<p>
			The only tool you need to make changes to most of BugTracker.NET is a text editor. I personally recommend
			the Community Edition of Visual Studio. Use the "Open Website" command.

		<p>
			There are some major parts of BugTracker.NET that I didn't write:
		<ul>
			<li>Parsing of incoming email uses <a
					href=http://anmar.eu.org/projects/sharpmimetools />SharpMimeTools.dll</a>, built from the files in
				the SharpMime folder.
				SharpMimeTools is another open source project, created by Angel Marin. More info at <a target=_blank
					href=http://anmar.eu.org/projects/sharpmimetools />http://anmar.eu.org/projects/sharpmimetools</a>
				<p>
			<li>Editing with fonts and colors uses <a href="http://ckeditor.com">CKEditor</a>.
				<p>
			<li>The full text uses <a href="http://www.lucene.net">Lucene.NET</a>.
		</ul>

		<p>

			Where is the solution/.sln file? You don't need one. You can work with the code with any text editor.
			For the best experience working with BugTracker.NET in Visual Studio, open and build it as a "Web Site".

		<p>
			If you work with the code, you'll notice it's not written in an MVC style, nor even the earlier
			"code-behind" style.
		<p>
			I started BugTracker.NET in 2002 as a learning project, to teach myself .NET and C#, to get those
			technologies on my resume. At the time I didn't own Visual Studio, so I went about
			learning .NET the same way I had learned Java in its early days: I downloaded the SDK, edited files using a
			text editor, and compiled
			using the command line.
