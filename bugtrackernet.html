		<div class="header">About BugTracker.NET</div>

		<p>
			BugTracker.NET is a free, open-source, web-based bug tracking and general purpose issue tracking
			application.
			It is in daily use by thousands of development, customer support, and help desk teams around the world.
		</p>

		<p>
			BugTracker.NET is easy to install and learn how to use.
			When you first install it, it is very simple and you can start using it right away.
			Later, you can change its configuration to handle your needs if they are more complex.
		</p>

		<p>
			BugTracker.NET is written using
			<a href="https://www.asp.net">ASP.NET</a>,
			<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">C#</a>, uses the .NET 4.x Framework, and Microsoft
			SQL Server (or its free cousin,
			<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express">SQL Server Express</a>).
		</p>

		<div style="background-color: yellow; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 6px">
			Attention!. Please check out my new app <a href="https://github.com/ctrager/budoco">Budoco</a>
			<br><br>
			Budoco is <b>BU</b>gTracker.NET on <b>DO</b>tnet <b>CO</b>re.
			<br><br>
			I started writing BugTracker.NET in 2001.
			As of 2020, BugTracker.NET still works fine using the latest versions of Windows, SQL Server, and the
			.NET 4 framework.
			However, BugTracker.NET can NOT run on the .NET 5, aka, the cross platform "Dotnet Core" 5.
			But don't panic!
			Microsoft has a great track record of keeping old stuff alive.
			<br><br>
			<a href="https://github.com/ctrager/budoco">Budoco</a> has, or will have, the best 80% of
			BugTracker.NET's features.
			It is built on .NET Core 5 and uses PostgreSQL instead of MS SQL Server.
			It runs on Linux as well as Windows.

				BugTracker.NET is a very flexible, powerful and easily configured bug/task tracking tool...I checked out
